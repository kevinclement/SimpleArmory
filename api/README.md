As part of the new developer portal, blizzard removed ability to hit API without a OATH token.  This is a pain for simple site like SA, as I don't want to ask people to credential to battle net.  To work around this we had to stand up a proxy api server.  I did this in cloudflare for now.

See proxy.js for current version that is deployed.
