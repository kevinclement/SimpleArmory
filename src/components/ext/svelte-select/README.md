## Total Hack ##
I couldn't get svelte/rollup/snowpack to properly include files out of node_modules, so I couldn't
just include svelte-select as a depenency.  Given svelte/kit is not even in beta yet, I didn't want to spend
too much time on it, so just did a copy from node_modules into this folder for now.
