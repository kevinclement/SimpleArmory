<div>Looks like we had trouble loading your {page} from blizzard.
<div style="padding-bottom:8px;">This has been known to happen in a few cases:</div>
</div>
  <ul>
    <li>The character name or realm was spelled incorrectly. Click <a href="#/">here</a> to try again.</li>
    <li><code>"Share my game data with community developers"</code> is disabled in account profile.  See <a href="https://account.blizzard.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://account.blizzard.com/privacy</a></li>
    <li>The character has been inactive. If this is your profile, try logging in and out of the character in the game client.</li>
    <li>The character is below level 10 and thus cannot be displayed.</li>
  </ul>
